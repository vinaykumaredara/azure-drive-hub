# Book Now Button - P0 Fix QA Checklist

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **UI/Layout Fixes** (Lines 247-280, CarCardModern.tsx)
- ✅ Added explicit z-index: Contact (z-10), Book Now (z-20)
- ✅ Container z-index increased from z-10 to z-20
- ✅ Both buttons have `flex-shrink-0` to prevent layout collapse
- ✅ Both buttons disabled during loading state
- ✅ Book Now shows "Opening..." text during load
- ✅ Added console.debug for all button clicks

### 2. **Loading State UX** (Lines 284-304, CarCardModern.tsx)
- ✅ Loading overlay shown between click and modal open (z-9998)
- ✅ Spinner with "Opening booking flow..." message
- ✅ Overlay prevents double-clicks during load

### 3. **Resume Logic Race Condition** (useBookingResume.ts)
- ✅ Fixed infinite loop using `useRef` for stable callback
- ✅ Added mutex lock (`resumeLockRef`) to prevent concurrent attempts
- ✅ Separated auth listener from custom event listener
- ✅ Added 10-second timeout for DB queries
- ✅ Improved error handling with AbortController
- ✅ Comprehensive logging at all steps

### 4. **Smart Modal Step Detection** (EnhancedBookingFlow.tsx)
- ✅ Starts on 'dates' if phone exists, 'phone' if not
- ✅ Checks both `profile.phone` and `user.phone`
- ✅ Logs initial step decision

### 5. **Modal Rendering** (EnhancedBookingFlow.tsx)
- ✅ Body scroll lock on modal open
- ✅ Restored scroll on modal close
- ✅ Consistent z-9999 for modal
- ✅ Defensive check: only render if `car && isBookingFlowOpen`
- ✅ Added close logging

### 6. **Test Coverage**
- ✅ Unit tests for button z-index and layout
- ✅ Tests for signed-in/signed-out flows
- ✅ Tests for concurrent click protection
- ✅ Tests for Contact button independence
- ✅ Integration tests for resume flow
- ✅ Tests for expired intent handling
