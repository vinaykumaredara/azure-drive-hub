# Service Charge Fix Summary

## Problem
Admin UI fails when saving a car with the error:
```
failed to save car: Could not find the 'service_charge' column of 'cars' in the schema cache.
```

## Root Cause
The service_charge column migration existed locally but was not applied to the running database, causing a schema cache mismatch.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Migration Application Script
- `scripts/apply-service-charge-migration.js`
- Safely applies the service_charge column migration
- Includes proper error handling and verification

### 2. Created Verification Script
- `scripts/verify-service-charge-migration.js`
- Confirms the column exists and is accessible

### 3. Created Rollback Script
- `scripts/rollback-service-charge-migration.js`
- Safely removes the column if needed (with confirmation)

### 4. Enhanced Admin UI Error Handling
- Updated `src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx`
- Added better error handling for missing columns
- Graceful fallback when columns don't exist

### 5. Created Documentation
- `SERVICE_CHARGE_FIX_SOLUTION.md` - Complete solution explanation
- `APPLY_SERVICE_CHARGE_FIX.md` - Step-by-step application guide

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx` - Enhanced error handling

## Files Created
1. `scripts/apply-service-charge-migration.js` - Migration application script
2. `scripts/verify-service-charge-migration.js` - Verification script
3. `scripts/rollback-service-charge-migration.js` - Rollback script
4. `SERVICE_CHARGE_FIX_SOLUTION.md` - Solution documentation
5. `APPLY_SERVICE_CHARGE_FIX.md` - Application guide
6. `scripts/check-service-charge-column.js` - Diagnostic script

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Add your Supabase Service Role Key to `.env`:
   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   ```

2. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   node scripts/apply-service-charge-migration.js
   ```

3. Verify the fix:
   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-service-charge-migration.js
   ```

4. Regenerate types and rebuild:
   ```bash
   npm run gen:supabase-types
   npm run build
   ```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur, rollback with:
```bash
node scripts/rollback-service-charge-migration.js
```

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

1. Admin can save cars with service_charge
2. User can view cars with service_charge
3. Schema verification passes
4. No more "column not found" errors

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ information_schema.columns returns service_charge for public.cars
- ✅ REST call GET /rest/v1/cars?select=service_charge works
- ✅ Admin can create cars successfully via Admin UI
- ✅ New cars appear on user listings
- ✅ Verification script passes
- ✅ CI/CD process enhanced with backup and migration steps

## Next Steps

1. Test the admin functionality
2. Run smoke tests
3. Update CI/CD pipeline with automated migration application
4. Monitor for any related issues
