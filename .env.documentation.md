# Environment Variables Documentation

## Supabase Configuration

The `.env` file contains Supabase configuration that is **SAFE TO COMMIT** to version control:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="rcpkhtlvfvafympulywx"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="eyJhbGc..."
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://rcpkhtlvfvafympulywx.supabase.co"
```

### ✅ Why This Is Safe

These are **publishable/anon keys** that are:
- Designed to be embedded in client-side code
- Protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the database
- Safe to expose in public repositories
- The standard Supabase architecture for frontend applications

### ⚠️ What Should NEVER Be Committed

The following keys are **SECRET** and must never be committed:
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Full database access, backend only
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Payment processing secret
- `RAZORPAY_SECRET_KEY` - Payment processing secret
- Any key with "SECRET" in the name

These should only exist in:
- Supabase Edge Function secrets (managed via Supabase Dashboard)
- `.env.local` for local development (added to `.gitignore`)

## Security Model

1. **Frontend (Public Keys)**
   - Uses publishable/anon keys from `.env`
   - Access controlled by RLS policies
   - Safe for public exposure

2. **Backend (Secret Keys)**
   - Uses service role keys stored in Supabase secrets
   - Never exposed to client
   - Full database access with proper validation

## Environment Setup

For local development:
1. Copy `.env` to `.env.local`
2. Add any local overrides to `.env.local`
3. Never commit `.env.local`
