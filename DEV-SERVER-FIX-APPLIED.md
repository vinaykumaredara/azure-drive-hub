# RP CARS - Dev Server Fix Applied

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to make the local development server reliable, fix the blank page issue, and harden the dev workflow to avoid port conflicts.

## Issue Summary

The development server was failing to start with import errors related to image utilities, specifically:
- Missing export function `getPublicOrSignedUrl` in [imageUtils.ts](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/utils/imageUtils.ts)
- Import conflicts in [AdminCarManagement.tsx](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx) and [useCars.ts](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/hooks/useCars.ts)

## Root Cause

When implementing the image upload fixes, we created a new [src/utils/imageUtils.ts](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/utils/imageUtils.ts) file with updated functions but forgot to include the `getPublicOrSignedUrl` function that was being used by existing components.

Additionally, there were import conflicts in the AdminCarManagement component that could cause issues with image handling.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added Missing Function**: Added the missing [getPublicOrSignedUrl](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/utils/imageUtils.ts#L50-L74) function to [src/utils/imageUtils.ts](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/utils/imageUtils.ts) to maintain backward compatibility with existing code while preserving new functionality.

2. **Fixed Import Issues**: Cleaned up imports in:
   - [src/hooks/useCars.ts](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/hooks/useCars.ts)
   - [src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx)

3. **Created Repair Script**: Created [scripts/repair-image-urls.js](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/scripts/repair-image-urls.js) to fix any existing database entries with incorrect image URLs.

4. **Created Verification Scripts**: Created scripts to verify the fixes are working correctly:
   - [scripts/verify-image-fix.js](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/scripts/verify-image-fix.js)
   - [scripts/verify-database-images.js](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/scripts/verify-database-images.js)

## Verification

Database verification shows:
- All cars in the database now have valid HTTP URLs for images
- No invalid or broken image URLs detected
- The development server now starts successfully without import errors

## Files Modified

1. [src/utils/imageUtils.ts](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/utils/imageUtils.ts) - Added missing [getPublicOrSignedUrl](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/utils/imageUtils.ts#L50-L74) function
2. [src/hooks/useCars.ts](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/hooks/useCars.ts) - Fixed import issues
3. [src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx) - Fixed import issues
4. [scripts/repair-image-urls.js](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/scripts/repair-image-urls.js) - Created repair script
5. [scripts/verify-image-fix.js](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/scripts/verify-image-fix.js) - Created verification script
6. [scripts/verify-database-images.js](file:///c:/Users/vinay/carrental/azure-drive-hub/scripts/verify-database-images.js) - Created database verification script

## Expected Outcome

With these fixes implemented:
1. The development server starts successfully without import errors
2. Admin UI continues to show images correctly
3. User UI now shows the same images instead of broken placeholders
4. Both interfaces use the same canonical public URLs for images
5. Image handling is consistent across the application

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Vite Configuration Updates
**File**: `vite.config.ts`
- Changed `host` from `"localhost"` to `true` to allow external connections
- Changed `strictPort` from `true` to `false` so Vite will pick the next free port if 5173 is in use
- Simplified HMR configuration

### 2. Package.json Script Updates
**File**: `package.json`
- Added `dev:preflight` script: `npx kill-port 5173 || true`
- Updated `dev` script to run preflight first: `npm run dev:preflight && vite`
- Added `dev:clean` script: `npm run dev:preflight && vite`
- Added `test:smoke` script for smoke testing
- Installed `kill-port` as a dev dependency

### 3. README Documentation
**File**: `README.md`
- Added "Development Troubleshooting" section with Windows-specific port conflict resolution commands
- Documented the `npm run dev:clean` helper script

### 4. VS Code Debug Configuration
**File**: `.vscode/launch.json`
- Updated to use correct port (5173 instead of 8080)
- Added explicit port configuration to prevent auto-attach conflicts

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
**Files**: 
- `src/main.tsx` - Added dev-only logger that prints environment and local URL
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Created error boundary component to show helpful UI with stack trace in dev
- `src/App.tsx` - Wrapped app content with ErrorBoundary

### 6. Developer Experience Improvements
**Files**:
- `DEV_CHECKLIST.md` - Created comprehensive developer checklist
- `scripts/smoke-test.js` - Created smoke test script
- `scripts/verify-dev-server.js` - Created verification script
- `scripts/test-dev-fixes.cjs` - Created test script to verify all fixes

## Verification Results

✅ All fixes have been successfully applied and tested

### Manual QA Steps Verified:
1. ✅ `npm run dev` completes and prints Local URL
2. ✅ Browser loads app without blank white page
3. ✅ No port conflict after following README steps
4. ✅ Clear instructions in README to resolve port conflicts

## Key Benefits

1. **Port Conflict Resolution**: The development server will now automatically pick the next available port if 5173 is in use
2. **Automated Cleanup**: The `dev:preflight` script automatically kills any process using port 5173 before starting the server
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error boundaries and logging provide better debugging information
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear instructions for troubleshooting common development issues
5. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Additional scripts and tools make development more efficient

## How to Use the New Features

### Starting the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Clean Start (kills port 5173 first)
```bash
npm run dev:clean
```

### Port Conflict Resolution (Windows)
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
tasklist /FI "PID eq <PID>"
taskkill /F /PID <PID>
```

### Running Smoke Tests
```bash
npm test:smoke
```
