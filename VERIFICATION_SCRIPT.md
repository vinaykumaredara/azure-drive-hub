# Verification Script for Admin Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This script provides step-by-step instructions to verify that all admin functionality has been correctly implemented and is working as expected.

## Prerequisites
1. Supabase project with proper credentials
2. Service role key for admin operations
3. Application running locally or deployed

## Verification Steps

### 1. Database Schema Verification

#### Check that required tables exist and have correct columns:

```sql
-- Check cars table
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name='cars' AND column_name IN ('price_in_paise','currency');

-- Check users table
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name='users' AND column_name IN ('is_suspended','suspension_reason','suspended_at','suspended_by');

-- Check system_settings table
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name='system_settings';

-- Check audit_logs table
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name='audit_logs';
```

### 2. Admin Car Management Verification

#### a) Login as admin and create a car:

1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard â†’ Car Management
2. Click "Add Car" button
3. Fill in car details:
   - Title: "Test Verification Car"
   - Make: "Toyota"
   - Model: "Camry"
   - Year: 2023
   - Price per Day: 4500
   - Status: "published"
   - Upload at least one image
4. Click "Add Car"
5. Verify success message appears

#### b) Check database for inserted row:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.cars 
WHERE title = 'Test Verification Car' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Expected result:
- `price_in_paise` should be 450000 (4500 INR in paise)
- `currency` should be 'INR'
- `status` should be 'published'
- `image_urls` should contain public URLs

#### c) Check public user dashboard:

1. Logout as admin
2. Navigate to public user dashboard
3. Verify the "Test Verification Car" appears in the car listing
4. Verify price is displayed as â‚¹4,500.00 (using Indian formatting)

### 3. Customer Management Verification

#### a) Suspend a user:

1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard â†’ Customer Management
3. Find a test user in the list
4. Click "Suspend" button
5. Enter suspension reason: "Test suspension"
6. Confirm suspension
7. Verify success message appears

#### b) Check database for user suspension:

```sql
SELECT id, email, is_suspended, suspension_reason, suspended_at 
FROM public.users 
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';  -- Replace with actual test user email
```

Expected result:
- `is_suspended` should be true
- `suspension_reason` should be "Test suspension"
- `suspended_at` should have a timestamp

#### c) Check audit log:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'customer_suspend' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Expected result:
- Audit log entry should exist with action 'customer_suspend'

### 4. System Settings Verification

#### a) Update system settings:

1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard â†’ System Settings
3. Change "site_name" to "RP Cars Test"
4. Change "max_booking_days" to 45
5. Click "Save Settings"
6. Verify success message appears

#### b) Check database for updated settings:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.system_settings 
WHERE key IN ('site_name', 'max_booking_days');
```

Expected result:
- Settings should be updated with new values
- Values should be stored as JSON

#### c) Check audit log:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'settings_update' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Expected result:
- Audit log entry should exist with action 'settings_update'

### 5. Security & Compliance Verification

#### a) Check audit logs:

1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard â†’ Security & Compliance
3. Verify audit logs are displayed
4. Verify different action types are shown with appropriate icons
5. Test CSV export functionality

#### b) Check database for audit logs:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.audit_logs 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

Expected result:
- Audit logs should exist for various actions
- Each log should have action, description, user_id, and timestamp

### 6. Currency Formatting Verification

#### a) Check price displays:

1. Navigate to various pages showing car prices
2. Verify all prices are displayed in Indian Rupee format (â‚¹)
3. Verify proper grouping (e.g., â‚¹1,00,000.00 not â‚¹100,000.00)

#### b) Test currency utility functions:

In browser console or Node.js:
```javascript
// Test formatINRFromPaise function
import { formatINRFromPaise } from './src/utils/currency';

console.log(formatINRFromPaise(450000)); // Should output "â‚¹4,500.00"
console.log(formatINRFromPaise(10000000)); // Should output "â‚¹1,00,000.00"
```

### 7. Storage Bucket Verification

#### a) Check cars-photos bucket:

1. Login to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage â†’ Buckets
3. Verify "cars-photos" bucket exists and is public
4. Check storage policies allow admin uploads

#### b) Test image accessibility:

1. Create a car with an image
2. Copy the image URL from the database
3. Open the URL in a new browser tab
4. Verify the image loads correctly

### 8. Admin Designation Verification

#### a) Make user admin:

Using the make-admin script:
```bash
node scripts/make-admin.js rpcars2025@gmail.com
```

#### b) Check database:

```sql
SELECT id, email, is_admin 
FROM public.users 
WHERE email = 'rpcars2025@gmail.com';
```

Expected result:
- `is_admin` should be true

### 9. Automated Testing

#### a) Run TypeScript compilation:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Expected result:
- No compilation errors

#### b) Run admin functionality test:

```bash
node scripts/test-admin-functionality.js
```

Expected result:
- All tests should pass
- Output should show "ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!"

#### c) Run currency conversion test:

```bash
node scripts/test-currency-conversion.js
```

Expected result:
- All tests should pass
- Output should show "ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!"

## Expected Results Summary

âœ… Admin create/update car returns HTTP success
âœ… Inserted row has price_in_paise, currency='INR', status='published'
âœ… Images array with accessible URLs
âœ… New car is visible on public user dashboard
âœ… All UI prices display with â‚¹ using formatINRFromPaise
âœ… Admin pages show functional behavior and changes persist to DB
âœ… RLS policies in DB match the ones provided
âœ… npx tsc --noEmit returns clean output
âœ… SQL queries return expected results
âœ… Audit logs are created for admin actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Permission denied errors**: Ensure you're using the service role key for admin operations
2. **RLS policy violations**: Check that policies allow admin access to all tables
3. **Missing columns**: Ensure all migration scripts have been applied
4. **Image upload failures**: Verify storage bucket exists and policies are correct
5. **Audit log errors**: Ensure audit_logs table exists with correct schema

### Debugging Steps:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check network tab for failed API requests
3. Check Supabase logs for database errors
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
5. Ensure all migration scripts have been applied

## Rollback Procedures

If issues are encountered:

1. **Database changes**: Apply rollback migration scripts
2. **Frontend changes**: Revert to previous commit
3. **Configuration changes**: Restore previous configuration files

## Success Criteria

All verification steps should pass without errors. The application should:
- Allow admins to create/update cars with proper pricing
- Display prices correctly to users
- Maintain audit logs of all admin actions
- Properly manage customer accounts
- Allow configuration through system settings
- Provide security compliance features
