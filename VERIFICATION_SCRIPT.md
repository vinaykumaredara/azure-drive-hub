# Verification Script

This script provides step-by-step instructions to verify that all critical fixes have been applied correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before running this verification script, ensure you have:

1. The application running locally with `npm run dev`
2. Access to the Supabase dashboard
3. A test admin account
4. Test images ready for upload

## Step 1: Verify Build and Dev Server

### Expected Result
The dev server should start without any build errors.

### Verification
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Check output for:
   ```
   VITE v7.1.7  ready in 1079 ms
   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

✅ PASS if dev server starts without errors
❌ FAIL if there are build errors or esbuild pre-bundle errors

## Step 2: Verify TypeScript Configuration

### Expected Result
No TypeScript errors in editor or during build.

### Verification
1. Open `src/components/UserCarListing.tsx` in your editor
2. Check that imports from `@/utils/carImageUtils` are resolved correctly
3. Run `npm run type-check`

✅ PASS if no TypeScript errors
❌ FAIL if there are import resolution errors or type errors

## Step 3: Verify Image Display

### Expected Result
Images should display correctly in both admin and user interfaces.

### Verification
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/admin (login as admin)
2. Create a new car with images
3. Save the car
4. Check that images display in the admin car listing
5. Navigate to http://localhost:5173 (user view)
6. Check that the same car shows images correctly

#### DevTools Verification
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload the page
4. Find image requests
5. Verify they return HTTP 200 status

✅ PASS if images display correctly and return HTTP 200
❌ FAIL if images are broken or return HTTP 403/404

## Step 4: Verify Delete Flow

### Expected Result
Deleting a car should remove both the database record and associated images from storage.

### Verification
1. In admin interface, create a test car with images
2. Note the car ID and image names
3. Delete the car using the delete button
4. Check Supabase dashboard:
   - Car record should be removed from `cars` table
   - Images should be removed from `cars-photos` storage bucket

#### API Verification
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Delete a car
4. Find the delete request to `/functions/v1/delete-car`
5. Verify it returns HTTP 200 with success response

✅ PASS if car and images are deleted, API returns 200
❌ FAIL if either record or images remain, or API fails

## Step 5: Verify Orphan Cleanup

### Expected Result
Orphaned images script should identify and remove unused images.

### Verification
1. Manually upload an image to the `cars-photos` bucket (not associated with any car)
2. Run the cleanup script in dry-run mode:
   ```bash
   node scripts/cleanup-orphaned-images.js --dry-run
   ```
3. Verify the orphaned image is identified
4. Run the cleanup script in delete mode:
   ```bash
   node scripts/cleanup-orphaned-images.js --delete
   ```
5. Verify the orphaned image is removed from storage

✅ PASS if orphaned images are correctly identified and removed
❌ FAIL if orphaned images are not handled properly

## Step 6: Run All Tests

### Expected Result
All tests should pass without errors.

### Verification
1. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
2. Check that all test suites pass

✅ PASS if all tests pass
❌ FAIL if any tests fail

## Step 7: Check Database Schema

### Expected Result
Database should have the required image columns.

### Verification
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to Table Editor
2. View the `cars` table schema
3. Verify it has:
   - `image_paths` column (text array)
   - `image_urls` column (text array)

✅ PASS if required columns exist
❌ FAIL if columns are missing

```sql
-- Check cars table
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name='cars' AND column_name IN ('price_in_paise','currency');

-- Check users table
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name='users' AND column_name IN ('is_suspended','suspension_reason','suspended_at','suspended_by');

-- Check system_settings table
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name='system_settings';

-- Check audit_logs table
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name='audit_logs';
```

### 2. Admin Car Management Verification

#### a) Login as admin and create a car:

1. Navigate to various pages showing car prices
2. Verify all prices are displayed in Indian Rupee format (₹)
3. Verify proper grouping (e.g., ₹1,00,000.00 not ₹100,000.00)

#### b) Test currency utility functions:

In browser console or Node.js:
```javascript
// Test formatINRFromPaise function
import { formatINRFromPaise } from './src/utils/currency';

console.log(formatINRFromPaise(450000)); // Should output "₹4,500.00"

## Expected Results Summary

✅ Admin create/update car returns HTTP success
✅ Inserted row has price_in_paise, currency='INR', status='published'
✅ Images array with accessible URLs
✅ New car is visible on public user dashboard
✅ All UI prices display with ₹ using formatINRFromPaise
✅ Admin pages show functional behavior and changes persist to DB
✅ RLS policies in DB match the ones provided
✅ npx tsc --noEmit returns clean output
✅ SQL queries return expected results
✅ Audit logs are created for admin actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Permission denied errors**: Ensure you're using the service role key for admin operations
2. **RLS policy violations**: Check that policies allow admin access to all tables
3. **Missing columns**: Ensure all migration scripts have been applied
4. **Image upload failures**: Verify storage bucket exists and policies are correct
5. **Audit log errors**: Ensure audit_logs table exists with correct schema

### Debugging Steps:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check network tab for failed API requests
3. Check Supabase logs for database errors
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
5. Ensure all migration scripts have been applied

## Rollback Procedures

If issues are encountered:

1. **Database changes**: Apply rollback migration scripts
2. **Frontend changes**: Revert to previous commit
3. **Configuration changes**: Restore previous configuration files

## Success Criteria

All verification steps should pass without errors. The application should:
- Allow admins to create/update cars with proper pricing
- Display prices correctly to users
- Maintain audit logs of all admin actions
- Properly manage customer accounts
- Allow configuration through system settings
- Provide security compliance features
