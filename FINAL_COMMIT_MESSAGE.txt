fix: resolve unresponsive Book Now button and harden booking flow

This commit resolves the issue where the Book Now button on the user dashboard was completely unresponsive and hardens the entire booking flow to be more robust and user-friendly.

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Unresponsive Book Now Button**:
   - Removed `e.preventDefault()` from button handler that was blocking navigation
   - Fixed CSS class conflicts in Button component usage
   - Removed redundant aria-disabled attribute

2. **ImageCarousel Touch Event Issues**:
   - Improved touch event handling with proper cleanup
   - Used passive event listeners to prevent scroll blocking
   - Added logic to prevent click interference only during actual swiping

3. **Booking Flow Improvements**:
   - Enhanced booking flow to be phone-first with proper state persistence
   - Added state restoration across login redirects
   - Improved phone number validation and redirection logic

## Files Modified:
- src/components/CarCardModern.tsx
- src/components/ImageCarousel.tsx
- src/pages/Booking.tsx
- Added comprehensive test coverage

## Test Results:
- All new tests passing
- Booking button now properly clickable
- Mobile touch events no longer interfere with button clicks
- Booking flow persists state correctly across redirects
