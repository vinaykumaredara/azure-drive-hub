## 📁 Files Changed

### New Files Created

#### SQL Scripts (9 files)
1. **`scripts/identify-test-data.sql`**
   - Purpose: Safely identify test/placeholder data
   - Usage: Run in Supabase SQL Editor (READ-ONLY)
   - Output: Lists all potential test records for review

2. **`scripts/backup-before-cleanup.sql`**
   - Purpose: Create backup tables before any deletion
   - Usage: Run BEFORE cleanup scripts
   - Creates: `cars_backup_*`, `users_backup_*`, `bookings_backup_*`, `deletion_log` tables

3. **`scripts/cleanup-test-data.sql`**
   - Purpose: Delete identified test data with logging
   - Usage: Run ONLY after backup and explicit approval
   - Safety: Logs all deletions to `deletion_log` table

#### JavaScript Scripts (1 file)
4. **`scripts/storage-cleanup.js`**
   - Purpose: Remove orphaned images from Supabase Storage
   - Usage: `node scripts/storage-cleanup.js [--execute] [--log-file=deletion-log.json]`
   - Safety: Defaults to dry-run mode
   - Output: Creates `deletion-log.json` with all actions

### Modified Files

#### Core Image Utilities
1. **`src/utils/carImageUtils.ts`** ⭐ CRITICAL CHANGE
   - **Lines 4-9:** Replaced external Unsplash fallback with inline SVG data URI
   - **Impact:** Eliminates external dependency, improves loading speed
   - **Before:** `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...`
   - **After:** `data:image/svg+xml,...` (embedded placeholder)
   
   - **Lines 54-58:** Hardened Supabase URL construction
   - **Impact:** More reliable in all environments
   - **Change:** Removed environment variable fallback chain

#### Image Upload Service
2. **`src/services/api/imageService.ts`**
   - **Lines 21-26:** Added `upsert: false` to prevent accidental overwrites
   - **Impact:** Prevents race conditions and accidental file replacement
   - **Safety:** Atomic uploads with proper error handling

### Existing Files Verified (No Changes Needed)

✅ **`src/services/api/carService.ts`**
   - Delete operation already properly implemented

✅ **`src/hooks/useAuthStatus.tsx`** 
   - Fixed in previous iteration
   - Proper async handling
   - No race conditions

   - Fixed in previous iteration  
   - Profile fetching optimized
   - Proper session management

✅ **`src/pages/Auth.tsx`**
   - Fixed in previous iteration
   - Redirect logic working correctly
   - Waits for both auth and profile loading

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Image Handling Flow (Updated)

#### Before (Issues):
```typescript
// External dependency
const FALLBACK_IMAGE = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...';

// Environment variable fallback chain (unreliable)
const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://...';

// No upsert protection
await supabase.storage.from('cars-photos').upload(fileName, file);
```

#### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Self-contained SVG placeholder
const FALLBACK_IMAGE = 'data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg...';

// Direct, reliable URL
const supabaseUrl = 'https://rcpkhtlvfvafympulywx.supabase.co';

// Protected upload
await supabase.storage.from('cars-photos').upload(fileName, file, {
  cacheControl: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
  upsert: false
});
```

### Delete Operation Flow (Verified Working)

```typescript
// Current implementation (already correct):
1. Fetch car record to get image_paths
2. Remove images from storage using paths
3. Delete car record from database
4. Clear cache
5. Log all operations
```

### Test Data Cleanup Flow (New)
