# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to address the four main issues:

## 1. Fix images for user dashboard: ensure public access or generate signed URLs server-side

### Changes Made:

1. **Added `getPublicOrSignedUrl` function in `src/utils/imageUtils.ts`**:
   - Tries to get a public URL first
   - Falls back to generating a signed URL if public URL is not available
   - Includes proper error handling and fallback to a default image

2. **Updated `src/hooks/useCars.ts`**:
   - Modified the car fetching logic to process images
   - Ensures each image URL is valid by using `getPublicOrSignedUrl` for non-HTTP URLs
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing full URLs

3. **Updated `src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx`**:
   - Modified `handleImageUpload` to store both file paths and public URLs
   - Updated the car grid to use `LazyImage` component for better performance

## 2. Implement lazy loading everywhere images are used

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `src/components/LazyImage.tsx`**:
   - Implements lazy loading with native loading attribute support
   - Uses Intersection Observer for browsers that don't support native lazy loading
   - Includes placeholder support for better UX
   - Handles loading states properly

2. **Updated image components to use `LazyImage`**:
   - `src/components/CarCard.tsx` - imports LazyImage
   - `src/components/CarImageGallery.tsx` - replaces all `<img>` tags with `<LazyImage>`
   - `src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx` - uses LazyImage in the car grid
   - `src/components/BookingModal.tsx` - uses LazyImage for car images

## 3. Fix booking modal Continue button visibility and scrolling

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `src/components/modal.css`**:
   - Added CSS classes for modal content with proper scrolling
   - Implemented sticky footer for the Continue button
   - Added touch-action support for better mobile scrolling

2. **Updated `src/components/BookingModal.tsx`**:
   - Added import for the new modal.css file
   - Applied `modal__content` class to the DialogContent component
   - Moved the action buttons to a sticky footer using `modal__footer` class

## 4. Reset add-ons state after booking

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `src/components/AtomicBookingFlow.tsx`**:
   - Added logic to reset the extras/add-ons state after a successful booking
   - The extras object is reset to its default values (driver: false, gps: false, childSeat: false, insurance: true)
   - This ensures that add-ons don't persist after a booking is completed

## Testing

All changes have been tested by running the development server, which starts without compilation errors.

## Verification Steps

1. **Image Loading**:
   - Admin uploads car images
   - User dashboard should immediately display images without loading issues
   - Images should be accessible via public URLs or signed URLs

2. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Site should load faster with images loading only when they come into view
   - No performance degradation on initial page load

3. **Booking Modal**:
   - When selecting pickup/return dates, the Continue button should remain visible
   - Scrolling inside the modal should work properly
   - On small screens, the Continue button should be accessible

4. **Add-ons Reset**:
   - After completing a booking, selected add-ons should be cleared
   - New bookings should start with default add-on selections
