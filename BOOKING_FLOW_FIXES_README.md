## QA Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Post-Login Redirect Flow**
   - Log out of the application
   - Navigate to homepage
   - Click "Book Now" on any car
   - Verify redirect to `/auth?next=/` (no nested params)
   - Complete login
   - Verify successful redirect to dashboard (no 404 errors)

2. **Test Phone Collection Flow**
   - Ensure your test user has NO phone number in profile
   - Log out of the application
   - Click "Book Now" on any car
   - Complete login
   - Verify PhoneModal appears automatically
   - Enter valid phone number (+91 format)
   - Verify booking can proceed after phone collection
   - Verify profile is refreshed after phone save

3. **Test Booking Restoration**
   - With phone number in profile
   - Log out and click "Book Now"
   - Login and verify booking draft is restored
   - Verify booking flow continues without phone modal
   - Verify draft validation works (missing dates go to dates step)

4. **Test Admin Redirects**
   - Login as admin user
   - Verify redirect to `/admin` after login
   - Test with pending bookings to ensure proper flow

5. **Test Error Handling**
   - Attempt booking with missing required fields
   - Verify validation errors are shown
   - Verify server errors are properly surfaced to user

### Automated Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Run: `pnpm test src/__tests__/bookingFlow.test.ts`
   - Verify saveDraftAndRedirect sets pendingBooking correctly
   - Verify next param format is single-level only
   - Run: `pnpm test src/__tests__/enhancedBookingFlow.test.ts`
   - Verify booking restoration logic
   - Run: `pnpm test src/__tests__/carCardBooking.comprehensive.test.tsx`
   - Verify CarCard and CarCardModern booking flow logic
   - Run: `pnpm test src/__tests__/createBookingHold.test.ts`
   - Verify Supabase error handling

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Run: `pnpm test src/__tests__/integration/bookingLoginFlow.test.ts`
   - Verify sessionStorage handling for booking drafts
   - Verify redirectToProfile flag management
   - Run: `pnpm test src/__tests__/integration/bookingResumeFlow.test.ts`
   - Verify complete flow: Book Now -> login -> PhoneModal -> save -> resume

## Server Configuration for Production

### Netlify Redirects

Add the following to your `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This ensures all client-side routes are properly handled by the SPA.

### Nginx Configuration (if using Nginx)

```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

## Debugging Notes

Temporary debug logs have been added to:
- `saveDraftAndRedirect` (useBooking.ts)
- Auth post-login handler (Auth.tsx)
- UserDashboard useEffect (UserDashboard.tsx)

These can be removed before merging to main.
