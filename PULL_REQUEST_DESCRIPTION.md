# Fix Unresponsive Book Now Button and Harden Booking Flow

## Description

This PR addresses the issue where the Book Now button on the user dashboard was completely unresponsive and hardens the entire booking flow to be more robust and user-friendly.

## Root Causes and Fixes

### 1. Unresponsive Book Now Button
- **Issue**: `preventDefault()` in button handler was preventing navigation
- **Fix**: Removed `e.preventDefault()` from the [handleBookNow](file://c:\Users\vinay\carrental\azure-drive-hub\src\components\CarCard.tsx#L56-L121) function in CarCardModern.tsx

### 2. ImageCarousel Touch Event Issues
- **Issue**: Touch events were swallowing clicks, making buttons unresponsive on mobile
- **Fix**: Improved touch event handling with proper cleanup and passive listeners

### 3. Booking Flow Improvements
- **Issue**: Booking flow wasn't phone-first and didn't persist state across login redirects
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive state persistence using sessionStorage and improved phone handling

### 4. Test Coverage
- **Issue**: Inadequate test coverage for booking scenarios
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive unit and integration tests
