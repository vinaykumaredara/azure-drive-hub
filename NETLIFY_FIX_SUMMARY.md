## ðŸ”§ Technical Explanation

### Root Cause

The blank screen issue was caused by missing environment variables. The application requires these VITE-prefixed variables to function:

1. `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - For Supabase database connection
2. `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - For Supabase authentication
3. `VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` - For Razorpay payment processing
4. `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - For Stripe payment processing

Without these variables, the application fails silently during initialization, resulting in a blank screen.

### Solution Approach

1. **Prevention:** Added environment variable verification script that runs before build
2. **Documentation:** Created clear instructions for Netlify environment variable setup
3. **Detection:** Enhanced error logging in the application to show missing variables
4. **Verification:** Added checklist for users to verify their setup

## âœ… Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Local Verification:**

   ```bash
   npm run verify:env
   ```

   This should show all required environment variables are set.

2. **Build Verification:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The build should complete successfully with environment variable confirmation messages.

3. **Netlify Deployment:**
   - Set all required environment variables in Netlify dashboard
   - Clear cache and redeploy
   - Check browser console for successful initialization messages

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Environment Variable Prefix:** All variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the frontend
2. **Cache Clearing:** Always clear Netlify cache when making environment variable changes
3. **Service Worker:** Service worker has been disabled to prevent caching issues
4. **Build Consistency:** Using pnpm ensures consistent builds between local and Netlify environments

## ðŸ“ž Support

If issues persist after following these steps, please provide:

1. Netlify build logs
2. Browser console output
3. Network tab information
4. Environment variable configuration (without exposing secret values)
