# UserCarListing Component Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Animation Variants Error
**Problem**: The `itemVariants` and `containerVariants` objects were not properly typed, causing TypeScript errors.
**Fix**: Added proper typing using `Variants` from framer-motion and imported the type.

### 2. Incorrect Car Filtering Logic
**Problem**: The component was only fetching available cars, but it should show both available and booked cars with different UI treatments.
**Fix**: Modified the Supabase query to fetch all published cars regardless of booking status, and let the UI handle the display logic.

### 3. Price Display Issue
**Problem**: Incorrect property access for price in paise in the booked car display section.
**Fix**: Corrected to use `car.pricePerDay * 100` instead of `car.price_in_paise` since the transformed object uses `pricePerDay`.

### 4. Real-time Subscription Filtering
**Problem**: The real-time subscription was not filtering for published cars only.
**Fix**: Added status filtering to the subscription callbacks to ensure only published cars are handled.
