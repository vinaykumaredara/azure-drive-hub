# RP Cars Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures that all fixes are properly applied and the application will work correctly when deployed to GitHub or Netlify.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### 1. Build Process

- [x] Vite configuration uses default minification settings
- [x] JavaScript bundles are generated during build
- [x] All assets are correctly copied to dist folder
- [x] Build completes without errors

### 2. Asset Management

- [x] Logo.svg exists in public directory with proper content
- [x] index.html references correct asset paths
- [x] manifest.json references correct asset paths
- [x] Service worker caches correct asset paths

### 3. Application Structure

- [x] dist folder contains index.html
- [x] dist folder contains JavaScript bundles in assets subdirectory
- [x] dist folder contains all required static assets
- [x] All asset references use relative paths

## Deployment Verification

### GitHub Deployment

1. Push changes to repository
2. Verify GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
3. Check that build generates proper output
4. Verify deployed site loads correctly

### Netlify Deployment

1. Push changes to repository
2. Verify Netlify build completes successfully
3. Check that all assets are served correctly
4. Verify deployed site loads correctly

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Functionality Tests

- [ ] Homepage loads without errors
- [ ] Car listings display correctly
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] Booking flow functions properly
- [ ] Admin dashboard accessible to admin users
- [ ] User dashboard accessible to regular users

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] Assets load efficiently
- [ ] Service worker caches content properly
- [ ] Application works offline (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting

### If Blank Screen Still Occurs

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all asset paths are correct
3. Ensure service worker is not caching stale content
4. Clear browser cache and try again
5. Check network tab for failed asset loads

### If Build Fails

1. Verify Node.js version (should be 20.19.0 or higher)
2. Check that all dependencies are properly installed
3. Ensure package.json scripts are correct
4. Verify Vite configuration is not overly restrictive

## Contact Information

For deployment issues, contact the development team with:

1. Screenshots of any errors
2. Browser console output
