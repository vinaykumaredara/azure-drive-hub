# RP Cars Development Notes

## Preview/WebView Issues Fixed ✅

The following changes were made to resolve the Service Worker registration error in preview mode:

### 🔧 **Changes Applied:**

1. **Service Worker Registration**: Updated to skip in development mode
2. **Service Worker File**: Temporarily moved to `sw.js.backup` to prevent loading
3. **Main.tsx**: Added service worker cleanup for development
4. **Vite Config**: Enhanced for better preview compatibility

### 🚀 **Development Mode:**

- Service Workers are **disabled** in development
- Preview should work without InvalidStateError
- Hot reload and WebSocket connections are stable
- All caching is handled by Vite in development

### 📝 **Production Mode:**

- Service Worker will be restored for production builds
- Rename `public/sw.js.backup` back to `public/sw.js` before production
- Use `npm run build` for production deployment

### 🛠️ **Troubleshooting:**

If preview issues persist:
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Check console for any remaining service worker references
