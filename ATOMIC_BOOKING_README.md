# Atomic Booking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds atomic booking functionality to prevent race conditions when multiple users try to book the same car simultaneously.

## Key Features

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Added `booking_status` column to track car availability
- Added `booked_by` column to track which user booked the car
- Added `booked_at` column to track when the car was booked
- Added `price_in_paise` column for accurate price storage
- Added `currency` column for multi-currency support

### 2. Atomic Booking Function
The `book_car_atomic(car_id UUID)` function ensures thread-safe booking:
1. Locks the car row with `FOR UPDATE`
2. Checks if the car is available
3. Updates the car status to 'booked' with user info
4. Inserts an audit log entry
5. Returns success/failure status

### 3. Security
- RLS policies ensure users can only see published and available cars
- Admins have proper insert/update permissions
- Function uses SECURITY DEFINER to ensure proper execution
- All actions are logged in audit_logs table

## Implementation Details

### Admin Car Management
- Image-first upload pattern
- Price stored as `price_in_paise` (integer) for accuracy
- Proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Audit logging for all actions

### User Experience
- Users only see published and available cars
- Clear indication when a car is already booked
- "Be fast next time" message for booked cars
- Atomic booking flow with proper error handling

## Usage

### For Admins
1. Use the Admin Car Management interface to add/update cars
2. Images are uploaded first, then car data is saved
3. Prices are stored in paise for accuracy
4. All actions are logged in the audit trail

### For Users
1. Browse available cars on the homepage
2. Cars already booked by others will show "Already booked. Be fast next time."
3. Available cars can be booked using the atomic booking flow
4. Booking is atomic - no race conditions possible

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

### Manual Verification
1. Run the database migrations
2. Verify structure with `verify-atomic-booking-structure.js`
3. Test admin create/update functionality
4. Test user view of available cars
5. Test booking flow with atomic function
6. Verify audit logs are created
7. Test concurrent booking attempts

### SQL Verification
Run the SQL verification script to check database structure:
```sql
-- Run the queries in verify-database-structure.sql
```

## Rollback
If issues are encountered, the rollback migration will:
- Drop the atomic booking function
- Remove booking-related columns from cars table
- Restore original RLS policies
- Drop related indexes

## Security Considerations
- All database operations use proper RLS policies
- The atomic booking function uses SECURITY DEFINER
- User authentication is required for booking
- Admin actions require admin privileges
- All actions are logged for audit purposes
