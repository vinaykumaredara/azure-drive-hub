# Final Steps to Complete the Migration

You've successfully applied the currency migration, but there are still some schema cache issues with the booking_status column. Follow these steps to complete the migration:

## Step 1: Apply the Complete Migration Script

1. Open the file `complete-migration.sql` in this directory
2. Copy the entire contents of the file
3. Go to your Supabase dashboard
4. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
5. Paste the SQL script
6. Click **Run** to execute the script

This script includes:
- All currency-related changes (which you've already applied)
- Atomic booking functionality (booking_status column and related features)
- Proper schema cache refresh

## Step 2: Wait for Schema Cache Refresh

After running the script, wait 30-60 seconds for the schema cache to refresh completely.

## Step 3: Verify the Complete Migration

Run the verification script to confirm everything is working:

```bash
node check-booking-status.js
```

You should see:
```
âœ… The booking_status column exists in the cars table
âœ… booking_status column check completed
ðŸŽ‰ The booking_status column exists!
```

Then run the admin functionality test:

```bash
node test-admin-functionality.js
```

## Step 4: Build and Deploy

If all verifications pass, build and deploy your application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy to your hosting platform.

## Troubleshooting

### If Verification Still Fails After 60 Seconds

1. **Restart your Supabase project**:
   - Go to Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings > Database
   - Click "Restart"

2. **Check the columns exist** by running this query in the SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name, column_name 
   FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND column_name IN ('currency', 'booking_status', 'price_in_paise')
   ORDER BY table_name, column_name;
   ```

## Security Reminder

- **Never commit your service key** to version control
- `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- Rotate your service key regularly for security

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console output of the scripts for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Supabase project is not paused or suspended
3. Ensure you're using the correct service role key (not the anon key)
