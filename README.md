## üìã How Booking Flow Works

The new booking flow implementation provides a seamless user experience with the following steps:

1. **User Authentication Flow**
   - When a user clicks "Book Now" on any car card:
     - If not signed in, a sign-in modal appears (or redirects to auth page)
     - After successful authentication, check if phone number exists
     - If no phone number, prompt user to enter phone number
     - Save phone number to user profile before proceeding

2. **Multi-Step Booking Modal**
   - **Step 1: Date & Time Selection**
     - Select start and end dates with validation
     - Choose pickup and return times
     - Dynamic cost calculation based on duration
   - **Step 2: Terms & Conditions**
     - Display comprehensive terms that must be accepted
     - Checkbox validation to proceed
   - **Step 3: License Upload**
     - Camera capture support for mobile users
     - File upload option for desktop users
     - Validation for image files (JPG, PNG) under 5MB
     - Upload to Supabase Storage and save URL to booking record
   - **Step 4: Payment Options**
     - Choice between 10% hold or full payment
     - For 10% hold: Create booking with "held" status and hold_until timestamp
     - For full payment: Process payment and create booking with "confirmed" status
   - **Step 5: Confirmation**
     - Display booking confirmation with all details
     - Show license URL, user phone, times, status, and payment info

3. **Database & Security**
   - All booking creation happens via Edge Functions for transactional safety
   - EXCLUDE constraint prevents overlapping bookings at database level
   - License documents stored securely in Supabase Storage
   - Phone numbers stored in user profiles for future bookings

4. **Admin Dashboard Integration**
   - Real-time display of all bookings with complete information
   - View license documents, user phone numbers, booking times, and payment status
   - Manage booking status (approve, cancel, complete)

## üß™ How to Test

### Unit Tests
Run the unit tests for the booking flow hooks:
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Key test files:
- `src/__tests__/hooks/useBookingFlow.test.ts` - Tests for booking flow state management
- `src/__tests__/functions/createBooking.test.ts` - Tests for Edge Function integration
- `src/__tests__/utils/bookingIntentUtils.test.ts` - Tests for booking intent persistence

### Integration Tests
Run integration tests for the booking system:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### End-to-End Tests
Run end-to-end tests for the complete booking flow:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Log out and click "Book Now" on any car
   - Verify sign-in modal appears or redirection to auth page
   - After login, if no phone number exists, verify phone collection modal appears
   - Enter phone number and verify it's saved to profile

2. **Booking Modal Flow**
   - Click "Book Now" on any available car
   - Complete Date & Time selection with valid dates
   - Accept Terms & Conditions
   - Upload a license image (test both camera and file upload)
   - Choose payment option (10% hold or full payment)
   - Verify booking confirmation appears

3. **Validation Testing**
   - Try to proceed without selecting dates (should show error)
   - Try to proceed without accepting terms (should show error)
   - Try to upload non-image files (should show error)
   - Try to select end date before start date (should show error)

4. **Admin Dashboard Verification**
   - Log in as admin
   - Navigate to Booking Management section
   - Verify all booking details are displayed correctly:
     - License URL with clickable link
     - User phone number
     - Booking times and duration
     - Status and payment information

5. **Database Verification**
   - Check that bookings are created with correct status
   - Verify license documents are stored in Supabase Storage
   - Confirm phone numbers are saved in user profiles
   - Test that overlapping bookings are prevented by database constraints

6. **Booking Intent Persistence**
   - Click "Book Now" while signed out
   - Verify pending intent is saved to localStorage
   - Complete sign-in process
   - Verify booking modal automatically opens for the intended car
   - Verify localStorage intent is cleared after successful resume

## üìà Performance & UX

### Lazy Loading
- Booking modal and heavy components are lazy-loaded for faster initial page load
- Code splitting implemented for optimal bundle size

### User Experience
- Smooth animations and transitions between booking steps
- Clear progress indicators showing current step
- Disabled "Next" buttons until validations pass
- Loading spinners during async operations
- Toast notifications for errors and success messages
- Mobile-friendly design with camera capture support

### Error Handling
- Defensive programming with comprehensive error handling
- Visible error toasts for all user actions
- No silent failures - every action shows feedback
- Graceful degradation for network issues

## üîí Security

### Authentication
- All booking operations require authenticated users
- Phone number collection secured through Supabase Auth
- Profile updates protected by RLS policies

### Data Protection
- License documents stored in private Supabase Storage bucket
- Database constraints prevent data integrity issues
- Edge Functions ensure server-side validation and transactional operations

### Payment Security
- Payment processing handled by trusted third-party providers
- No sensitive payment data stored in application database
- Edge Functions provide secure server-side booking creation

## üîÑ Booking Intent Persistence

### How It Works
The booking intent persistence feature ensures that users never lose their booking progress, even when they need to sign in first:

1. **Intent Storage**: When an unauthenticated user clicks "Book Now", the system saves the booking intent to localStorage with the car ID and timestamp.

2. **Sign-In Handling**: The user is redirected to the sign-in page with a clear message that their booking will be resumed automatically.

3. **Resume Logic**: After successful authentication, the system automatically:
   - Retrieves the saved intent from localStorage
   - Fetches the car details from the database
   - Opens the booking modal for that specific car
   - Clears the saved intent to prevent duplicate bookings

4. **Cross-Flow Support**: Works with both modal sign-ins and OAuth redirects, ensuring consistent behavior across all authentication methods.

### Technical Implementation
- **Utility Functions**: `src/utils/bookingIntentUtils.ts` contains all logic for saving, retrieving, and resuming booking intents
- **Component Integration**: `NewBookNowButton` handles intent saving before redirecting to sign-in
- **App-Level Resume**: `App.tsx` includes a component that listens for authentication state changes and resumes intents when the user becomes authenticated
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of cases where the car is no longer available or other errors occur during resume

### Benefits
- **Seamless UX**: Users don't need to remember which car they wanted to book
- **Robust**: Works across page reloads, OAuth redirects, and different sign-in methods
- **Secure**: Only stores minimal information (car ID) without sensitive data
- **Transparent**: Users are informed when their booking is being resumed
