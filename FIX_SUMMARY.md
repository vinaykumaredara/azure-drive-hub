# CI & Netlify Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ESLint Issues Resolved

#### CarCard.tsx

- **Problem**: useCallback hooks were being called conditionally due to early return statements, violating React's rules of hooks
- **Solution**: Moved all useCallback hooks to the top level of the component, before any conditional returns
- **Files affected**: `src/components/CarCard.tsx`

#### SimpleImage.tsx

- **Problem**: Used `@ts-ignore` instead of `@ts-expect-error` and missing description
- **Solution**: Replaced `@ts-ignore` with `@ts-expect-error` and added descriptive comment
- **Files affected**: `src/components/SimpleImage.tsx`

### 2. Pre-commit Hook Configuration

#### Husky Configuration

- **Problem**: Deprecated lines in pre-commit hook that would fail in husky v10.0.0
- **Solution**: Updated `.husky/pre-commit` to use the new format
- **Files affected**: `.husky/pre-commit`

### 3. Netlify Configuration

- **Status**: Already correctly configured to use npm (matching package-lock.json)
- **File**: `netlify.toml`

## Verification Performed

1. ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
3. ✅ Build completes successfully
4. ✅ Pre-commit hooks work correctly
5. ✅ No merge conflict markers found in source files

## Test Status

Note: There are existing test failures in the codebase that are unrelated to the ESLint/CI issues:

- Authentication context issues in tests
- Image handling test expectations
- Supabase mock issues in tests

These pre-existing test failures are outside the scope of this fix.

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/CarCard.tsx` - Fixed useCallback hook conditional call issues
2. `src/components/SimpleImage.tsx` - Fixed @ts-ignore comment
3. `.husky/pre-commit` - Updated husky configuration
4. `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Commands Verified

```bash
# ESLint check
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx

# TypeScript compilation
npm run type-check

# Build

```

## Branch
