# Booking Flow Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Unresponsive Book Now Button
**Problem**: The Book Now button on the user dashboard was completely unresponsive.

**Root Causes Found**:
- `preventDefault()` call in the button handler was preventing navigation
- Data-testid attribute mismatch between component and tests
- Potential overlay issues with ImageCarousel

**Fixes Applied**:
- Removed `e.preventDefault()` from the [handleBookNow](file://c:\Users\vinay\carrental\azure-drive-hub\src\components\CarCard.tsx#L56-L121) function in CarCardModern.tsx
- Standardized data-testid attribute to "bookNow"
- Improved ImageCarousel touch event handling to prevent click swallowing

### 2. ImageCarousel Touch Event Issues
**Problem**: Touch events in the carousel were interfering with button clicks.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added proper cleanup for touch event listeners
- Used passive event listeners to prevent scroll blocking
- Added logic to prevent click events only when actual swiping occurs

### 3. Booking Flow Improvements
**Problem**: Booking flow wasn't properly phone-first and didn't persist state across login redirects.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced booking state persistence using sessionStorage
- Added state restoration on component mount
- Improved phone number validation and redirection logic
- Added proper cleanup of booking state after successful booking

### 4. Test Coverage
**Problem**: Inadequate test coverage for booking flow scenarios.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created comprehensive unit tests for CarCardModern component
- Added integration tests for the complete booking flow
- Verified path aliases and jest-dom configurations
- Added tests for both authenticated and unauthenticated user scenarios
