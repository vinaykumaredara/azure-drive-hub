# üìã Booking Flow Implementation - QA Checklist

## üéØ Overview
This PR implements a new, clean booking flow that replaces the old broken "Book Now" implementation with a multi-step modal-based flow that matches the exact user experience requirements.

## ‚úÖ QA Checklist

### üîß Code Removal
- [x] Remove old Book Now button and related handlers from `src/components/CarCardModern.tsx`
- [x] Remove old Book Now button and related handlers from `src/components/UserCarListing.tsx`
- [x] Remove old useBooking hook or replace with new implementation
- [x] Remove dead exports and update imports throughout the codebase
- [x] Verify no residual event handlers, imports, or dead context references remain

### üÜï New UI Components
- [x] `src/components/NewBookNowButton.tsx` - Minimal wrapper with identical visuals and placement
- [x] `src/components/BookingModal/BookingModal.tsx` - Multi-step booking modal (lazy-loaded)
- [x] `src/hooks/useBookingFlow.ts` - Encapsulates booking modal state and handlers
- [x] Verify all components follow existing code patterns and styling

### üîê Authentication & Phone Flow
- [x] Reuse existing auth system (Supabase Auth)
- [x] Implement lightweight phone capture step when needed
- [x] Persist phone to users table when provided
- [x] If user is unauthenticated, open sign-in flow and then proceed automatically
- [x] If user is authenticated but has no phone, prompt for phone before booking
- [x] If user is authenticated and has phone, proceed directly to booking flow

### üì± Booking Flow Steps
#### Step 1: Date & Time Selection
- [x] Start datetime and end datetime selection
- [x] Validation: start < end
- [x] Availability checking
- [x] Dynamic cost calculation

#### Step 2: Terms & Conditions
- [x] User must accept terms to proceed (checkbox)
- [x] Cannot proceed without accepting terms

#### Step 3: License Upload
- [x] Camera capture support on mobile (`<input accept="image/*" capture="environment">`)
- [x] File upload option
- [x] Upload file to Supabase Storage
- [x] Save URL in booking record
- [x] File type validation (images only)
- [x] File size validation (max 5MB)

#### Step 4: Payment Options
- [x] Choose 10% hold or Full payment
- [x] For 10%: Create booking with status "held" and held_until timestamp
- [x] Collect payment for 10% (Stripe or chosen provider)
- [x] For full: Process full payment and create booking with status "confirmed" only on successful payment

#### Step 5: Confirmation
- [x] Show confirmation to user
- [x] Persist booking in DB
- [x] Display all booking details

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Supabase Interactions
- [x] Storage: Upload license to licenses/ folder and get public or signed URL
- [x] Bookings: Create booking via Supabase Edge Function (transactional)
- [x] Payment: Integrate with Stripe (or chosen provider)
- [x] Return booking id and payment intent/client_secret from server function

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Migrations
- [x] Add/modify bookings table to include:
  - id
  - car_id
  - user_id
  - start_at
  - end_at
  - status
  - held_until
  - license_url
  - payment_info
  - created_at
- [x] Add booking_range and DB-level EXCLUDE constraint to prevent overlapping bookings:
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist;
  
  ALTER TABLE bookings
    ADD COLUMN booking_range tstzrange GENERATED ALWAYS AS (tstzrange(start_at, end_at)) STORED;
  
  ALTER TABLE bookings
    ADD CONSTRAINT no_overlapping_bookings EXCLUDE USING gist
      (car_id WITH =, booking_range WITH &&);
  ```
- [x] Migration file in `supabase/migrations/` with the SQL
- [x] Rollback SQL provided

### ‚ö° Edge Functions
- [x] `supabase/functions/create_booking` - Accepts authenticated user or guest phone, car_id, start_at, end_at, payment_choice
- [x] Transactionally:
  - Check overlapping bookings (and the DB constraint will protect too)
  - Insert booking with status: held or confirmed based on payment
  - Return booking id and data needed for payment (client_secret)
- [x] `supabase/functions/expire_holds` (scheduled) - Expire held bookings when held_until < now and change status to expired

### üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Dashboard
- [x] Ensure admin view lists bookings with:
  - License URL
  - User phone (or guest phone)
  - Times
  - Status
  - Payment summary

### üß™ Testing
- [x] Unit tests for `useBookingFlow`
- [x] Integration test for Edge Function (simulate overlapping booking attempts)
- [x] Add one end-to-end test that runs through the booking modal flow (basic)

### üìö Documentation
- [x] Update README with "How booking flow works" and "how to test" steps
- [x] Include this QA checklist in PR description

## üß™ Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Authentication Flow Testing
- [ ] Clicking "Book Now" when signed out opens sign-in modal and after success resumes booking
- [ ] Clicking "Book Now" when signed in with no phone prompts for phone and then starts booking
- [ ] Clicking "Book Now" when signed in with phone immediately starts booking

### 2. Date & Time Validation
- [ ] Cannot choose end date <= start date
- [ ] Cannot select dates in the past
- [ ] Dynamic cost calculation works correctly

### 3. License Upload
- [ ] License upload works from mobile camera
- [ ] License upload works from file selection
- [ ] File is uploaded to Supabase storage
- [ ] URL is saved in DB
- [ ] Invalid file types are rejected
- [ ] Files over 5MB are rejected

### 4. Payment Options
- [ ] 10% hold route:
  - [ ] Booking created as "held"
  - [ ] held_until set
  - [ ] 10% payment intent created
- [ ] Full payment route:
  - [ ] Booking created as "confirmed" only after successful payment

### 5. Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Admin sees booking entry with:
  - [ ] License URL
  - [ ] User phone
  - [ ] Times
  - [ ] Status
  - [ ] Payment summary

### 6. Database Safety
- [ ] Two concurrent booking attempts for the same car/time: only one succeeds (the DB constraint prevents the second)

### 7. Performance
- [ ] Booking modal is lazy-loaded
- [ ] Initial dashboard load is unaffected
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions between steps

### 8. Error Handling
- [ ] All user actions either show next UI or a visible error toast
- [ ] No silent failures
- [ ] Proper validation messages for all inputs

## üé® UX Requirements
- [ ] Progress indicator shows current step
- [ ] "Next" buttons disabled until current step fields are valid
- [ ] Loading spinners on async actions
- [ ] Modal is accessible and mobile-friendly
- [ ] Original styling of "Book Now" button maintained (same color, same hover)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Data Integrity
- [ ] All old Book Now code removed (search by keyword)
- [ ] Server-side booking creation to avoid race conditions
- [ ] Client only requests intent
- [ ] DB EXCLUDE constraint as safety net against race conditions
- [ ] Phone numbers stored securely
- [ ] License documents stored in private storage

## üöÄ Deployment
- [ ] Migration files included
- [ ] Edge function code included
- [ ] README updated
- [ ] Brief testing notes included
- [ ] Screenshots or short recording of new flow working (dev environment)

## üì∏ Screenshots
Include screenshots or a short recording of the new flow working in the development environment.

## üìù Notes for Reviewers
- Pay special attention to the authentication flow and phone collection
- Verify that the EXCLUDE constraint properly prevents overlapping bookings
- Check that all error handling is visible and user-friendly
- Ensure the booking modal is responsive and works well on mobile devices
