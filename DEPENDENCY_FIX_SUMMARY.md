# Dependency Fix Summary

## Issue
After code cleanup, the website was displaying a blank white screen and the development server was failing with dependency resolution errors for:
- @radix-ui/react-dialog
- @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
- @radix-ui/react-popover
- @radix-ui/react-select
- @radix-ui/react-toast
- @radix-ui/react-tooltip
- clsx
- sonner
- tailwind-merge
- motion-utils (additional issue that appeared later)

## Root Cause
The cleanup process caused dependency inconsistencies, particularly with UI component libraries and utility packages. Some packages had corrupted or incomplete files.

## Solution Applied
1. **Reinstalled core dependencies with specific versions**:
   ```
   npm install vite@5.2.0 @radix-ui/react-dialog@1.0.5 @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu@2.0.6 @radix-ui/react-popover@1.0.7 @radix-ui/react-select@2.0.0 @radix-ui/react-toast@1.1.5 @radix-ui/react-tooltip@1.0.7 --save-dev
   ```

2. **Reinstalled utility packages**:
   ```
   npm install clsx@2.0.0 sonner@1.4.0 tailwind-merge@2.0.0 --save
   ```

3. **Reinstalled Radix UI react-slot package**:
   ```
   npm install @radix-ui/react-slot@1.0.2 --save
   ```

4. **Removed and reinstalled all node_modules**:
   ```
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
   npm install
   ```

5. **Cleared Vite cache**:
   ```
   npm run clean:cache
   ```

## Verification
✅ Development server now starts successfully
✅ Application is accessible at http://localhost:5173/
✅ No dependency resolution errors
✅ Core functionality remains intact

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Pin dependency versions for critical packages
2. Use `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for consistent builds
3. Test application functionality after major cleanup operations
4. Keep a backup of working node_modules before significant changes
5. When encountering "Unexpected end of file" errors, remove and reinstall the affected packages
