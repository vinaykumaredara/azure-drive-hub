## Global Safety and QA

### Changes Made:
1. Created smoke test script `scripts/smoke-test.js` that:

   - Queries published cars as public
   - Logs in as regular user and reads dashboard
2. Created CI job script `scripts/ci-checks.sh` that:
   - Runs npx tsc --noEmit
   - Runs smoke test script
3. Created migration and rollback SQL files for all DB changes
4. Added typecheck pre-push hook suggestion

### Acceptance Criteria:
✅ npx tsc --noEmit is clean
✅ Smoke test passes
✅ Migration and rollback SQL files created
✅ Integration test or script for admin car creation to ensure no regressions

## Implementation Notes:

1. **Price Storage**: All prices are stored as integer price_in_paise and displayed using Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', { style: 'currency', currency: 'INR' })

2. **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security policies have been implemented to ensure proper access control

3. **Audit Logging**: Critical admin actions are logged in the audit_logs table

4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test scripts have been created for each feature set

5. **Safety**: All database changes include rollback migrations and proper error handling

## How to Test:

1. Apply migrations in order:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. Run typecheck:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

3. Run smoke test:
   ```bash
   node scripts/smoke-test.js
   ```

4. Run individual feature tests:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-car-visibility.js
   node scripts/test-currency-conversion.js
   node scripts/test-customer-management.js
   node scripts/test-system-settings.js
   node scripts/test-security-compliance.js
   ```

5. Run CI checks:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/ci-checks.sh
   ```
