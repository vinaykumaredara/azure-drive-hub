# Fix Unresponsive Book Now Button and Improve Booking Flow

## Description
This PR fixes the unresponsive "Book Now" button on the user dashboard and improves the overall booking flow reliability. The main issues were related to authentication context in tests and touch event handling interference.

## Root Causes and Fixes

### 1. Authentication Context in Tests
- **Problem**: CarCardModern tests were failing because components use `useAuth` hook but tests weren't providing AuthContext
- **Solution**: Added proper AuthContext mocking in `CarCardModern.test.tsx`

### 2. Touch Event Interference in ImageCarousel
- **Problem**: Touch event handlers in ImageCarousel were using `{ passive: false }` and not properly checking event targets, which could interfere with button clicks
- **Solution**: Updated ImageCarousel to use `{ passive: true }` and only handle touch events on the carousel container itself

### 3. Component Availability Logic
- **Problem**: Tests for disabled button state were not correctly setting up the car's availability status
- **Solution**: Updated test to properly set car status to 'unpublished' to make it unavailable

## Changes

### Fixed Files
1. `src/__tests__/CarCardModern.test.tsx` - Added proper AuthContext provider and fixed availability logic
2. `src/components/ImageCarousel.tsx` - Improved touch event handling to prevent click interference
3. `src/__tests__/BookingFlow.test.tsx` - Added basic booking flow test

### New Files
1. `BOOKING_FLOW_FIXES.md` - Documentation of fixes and root causes

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- All CarCardModern tests now pass
- New BookingFlow test passes
- ImageCarousel touch handling improved

### Manual QA
1. Navigate to user dashboard
2. Click "Book Now" button on any available car
3. Verify navigation to `/booking/:carId` route
4. Verify booking flow loads correctly
5. Test on both desktop and mobile devices
6. Verify touch interactions work properly on mobile

## Technical Details

### Authentication Context Fix
Added proper AuthContext provider with mock user data:
```typescript
const mockAuthContext = {
  user: mockUser,
  session: null,
  isLoading: false,
  isAdmin: false,
  profile: { id: 'user1', phone: '+919876543210' },
  profileLoading: false,
  refreshProfile: vi.fn(),
  signIn: vi.fn(),
  signUp: vi.fn(),
  signOut: vi.fn(),
  signInWithGoogle: vi.fn(),
};
```

### Touch Event Handling
Changed from passive: false to passive: true and added target checking:
```typescript
// Only handle touch events on the image itself, not on child buttons
if (e.target !== e.currentTarget) {
  return;
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Book Now button is now responsive
- ✅ Touch interactions work properly on mobile devices
- ✅ Tests pass and provide better coverage
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
