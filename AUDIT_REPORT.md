# Application Audit Report

## Overview

This audit report summarizes the comprehensive review and fixes applied to the car rental application to ensure stability, security, and feature completeness.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Security Issues

**Fix**: Updated to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values
**Files Modified**: `apply-migration.cjs`

### 2. Database Schema
**Issue**: Missing columns for atomic booking functionality
**Fix**: Created comprehensive migrations to add all required columns:
- `booking_status` (TEXT, DEFAULT 'available')

- `booked_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- `price_in_paise` (BIGINT)
- `currency` (TEXT, DEFAULT 'INR')
- `images` (TEXT[])

**Files Created**: 
- `supabase/migrations/20250918010000_fix_schema_cache_and_columns.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250918010001_create_atomic_booking_function.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250918010002_create_system_settings_table.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20250918010003_rollback_fixes.sql`

### 3. Supabase Client Configuration
**Issue**: Hardcoded Supabase credentials
**Fix**: Updated to use environment variables with fallbacks
**Files Modified**: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`

### 4. Admin Car Management
**Issue**: Admin-created cars not appearing in user listings
**Fix**: Ensured new cars are always set to 'published' status
**Files Modified**: `src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx`

### 5. Atomic Booking Functionality
**Issue**: Race conditions in booking process
**Fix**: Implemented atomic booking function with row locking
**Files Created**: `supabase/migrations/20250918010001_create_atomic_booking_function.sql`

### 6. RLS Policies
**Issue**: Incorrect Row Level Security policies
**Fix**: Fixed RLS policies to allow public read of published cars and admin operations
**Files Modified**: `supabase/migrations/20250918010000_fix_schema_cache_and_columns.sql`

### 7. Frontend Components
**Issue**: Various frontend issues and missing functionality
**Fix**: 
- Created robust `useCars` hook for car data fetching
- Improved error handling in CarListing component
- Added fallback logic for schema cache errors in AdminCarManagement
- Properly wired CustomerManagement, SystemSettings, and SecurityCompliance components to backend

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useCars.ts`
- `src/components/CarListing.tsx`
- `src/components/AdminCarManagement.tsx`
- `src/components/CustomerManagement.tsx`
- `src/components/SystemSettings.tsx`
- `src/components/SecurityCompliance.tsx`

## Tests Created

### 1. Concurrent Booking Test
**Purpose**: Verify atomic booking prevents race conditions
**File**: `src/tests/concurrent-booking.test.ts`

### 2. Smoke Test
**Purpose**: Verify basic application functionality
**File**: `scripts/smoke-test.js`

### 3. Existing Tests
**Purpose**: Verify existing functionality remains intact
**Files**: 
- `src/tests/atomic-booking.test.ts`
- `src/tests/integration.test.tsx`

## Verification Steps

### 1. Database Schema Verification
```sql
-- Check cars table columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'cars'
ORDER BY column_name;

-- Check indexes
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'cars';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'cars';

-- Check audit logs
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check system settings
SELECT * FROM system_settings;
```

### 2. Functionality Tests
1. **Admin Car Creation**
   - Log in as admin
   - Create a new car
   - Verify car is created with 'published' status
   - Verify car appears in user dashboard

2. **User Car Listing**
   - Visit public site as regular user
   - Verify published cars are displayed
   - Verify images load correctly

3. **Atomic Booking**
   - Attempt to book a car
   - Verify booking is atomic (no race conditions)
   - Verify booking is recorded in audit logs

4. **Admin Pages**
   - Verify Customer Management shows real user data
   - Verify System Settings can be edited and saved
   - Verify Security & Compliance shows audit logs

### 3. Security Verification
```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
git grep -n "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\|postgresql://"
```

## CI/CD Pipeline Recommendations

### 1. Migration Application
```bash
supabase db push
```

### 2. Schema Cache Refresh
For hosted Supabase:
- Trigger project restart in dashboard
- Or redeploy frontend application

For self-hosted:
```bash
docker-compose restart postgrest realtime
```

### 3. Smoke Tests
```bash
node scripts/smoke-test.js
```

### 4. Integration Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Rollback Plan

### 1. Database Rollback
Apply rollback migration:
```bash
supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/20250918010003_rollback_fixes.sql
```

### 2. Code Rollback
Revert to previous commit:
```bash
git checkout previous-commit-hash
```

### 3. Database Restore
If needed, restore database from backup.

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Indexes
Created indexes for better query performance:
- `idx_cars_booked_by` on `booked_by`
- `idx_cars_price_in_paise` on `price_in_paise`
- `idx_cars_status` on `status`

### 2. Query Optimization
- Added proper filtering in `useCars` hook
- Optimized car listing queries
- Added proper error handling

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Environment Variables
- Removed hardcoded credentials
- Used environment variables for all sensitive data

### 2. RLS Policies
- Implemented proper Row Level Security
- Restricted access based on user roles

### 3. Audit Logging
- Added comprehensive audit logging for admin actions
- Created audit_logs table for tracking
